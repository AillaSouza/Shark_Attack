# Project Overview :shark:
This project is part of a coding quest challenge where our team worked on cleaning and analysing a dataset of shark attacks. The aim of the quest is to practice data wrangling techniques in Python, using the pandas library, to prepare the dataset for analysis.

# Data Cleaning Techniques Applied

- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Formatting inconsistent data.
- Manipulating strings and categories.
- Date formatting and processing.

# Business Case
Our business aims to harness real-world shark attack data to strategically target and optimise the sales of our shark-themed merchandise, including T-shirts, hoodies, and mystery boxes. By capitalising on peopleâ€™s inherent curiosity and fascination with sharks, we will drive sales and increase brand awareness.
